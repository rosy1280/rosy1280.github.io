Rosalyn Metz is the Chief Technology Officer for Libraries and Museum at Emory University, where she leads a cross-functional team dedicated to advancing the university’s cultural heritage organizations through resilient, human-centered technology. Her leadership at Emory has driven large-scale transformations, from reimagining infrastructure to guiding the adoption of open-source platforms that ensure long-term access to knowledge and collections.

Beyond Emory, Rosalyn is deeply engaged in shaping the future of open infrastructure. She has held leadership roles in the [Fedora](https://fedorarepository.org/), [Oxford Common File Layout (OCFL)](https://ocfl.io/), and [Samvera](https://samvera.org/) communities, co-authored governance and financial models, and served as Chair of various governance groups. Her work has been instrumental in the development and implementation of widely adopted open-source applications.

Rosalyn is also a writer and consultant, extending her expertise to the broader library and cultural heritage community. Through her Substack newsletter, [The Digital Shift](https://rosalynmetz.substack.com), she explores the intersections of technology, open infrastructure, and higher education and the cultural heritage ecosystem. Her consulting work has helped organizations navigate complex technology decisions, implement open solutions, and foster cultures of trust and collaboration.

At the heart of Rosalyn’s work is a belief that leadership means listening deeply, building trust, and creating systems where people and technologies thrive together. She is committed to ensuring that today’s choices in technology contribute to a more open, just, and sustainable tomorrow.
